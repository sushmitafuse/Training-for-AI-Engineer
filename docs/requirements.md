## Context on the Product

1. **Why do you need this new system? What is the business need?**

    This new system is needed to understand the work satisfaction of the employee especially admist the covid and working from home situation. Detecting the sentiments by collecting twitter post of employee, we can gain deeper insight to know how happy employees are and also know about their mental health status. Through these knowledge, company can increase productivity of employee by bringing different engaging, team building activities and also addressing mental health.

2. **Is there a system in place to do it right now (even if manual)? If so, how is it done right now? Is the process documented?**

    Emotion detection has been carried out for last three decades and it's getting popularity with growing social media platforms or evolition of Web 2.0 which has created new dimension for freedom of expression. The important emotion models that has been developed are Discrete emotion models(DEMs) and Dimensional emotion models (DiEMs).The discrete models of emoion places emotions into distinct classes and dimensional emotion models emphasize that emotions are dependent.

    Under Discrete emotion models are:
    
    - The Paul Ekman model that distinguishes emotions based on six  basic categories of happiness, sadness, anger, disgust and fear.
    - The Robert Plutchik model added two more emotion i.e acceptancec/trust and anticipation.
    - Orthony, Clore, and Collins (OCC) model emphasized that emotion are based on human perception of events and discretized emotions into 22 classes adding relief, envy, reproach, self‐reproach, appreciation, shame, pity, disappointment, admiration, hope, fears‐confirmed, grief, gratification, gloating, like, and dislike.

    Under Dimentional emotion  models (DiEMs):

    - Russell presents a circular two‐dimensional model prominent in dimensional emotions representation called the circumplex of affect.
    - Plutchik presents a 2‐dimensional wheel of emotions that shows Valence on the vertical axis and Arousal on the horizontal axis. 
    - Russell and Mehrabian also present a 3‐dimensional emotion model made up of Valence/Pleasure, Arousal, and Dominance as the third dimension.

    The basic and crucial needs of the system is to correctly understand the sentiments of the employee and predict their emotion.

    This product will be used especially by the Human Resource or Training department.

2. **Will the system need to integrate with any other type of software?**

    Since the application only accepts classification of emotion in English language, in order to translate tweet on other languages like Nepali, online language translator like Microsoft  Bing,  Google  Cloud  Translate,  etc needs to be integrated. 

## About the Data

1. **What data do you have that might be related, in any way, to the problem being solved?**
    
    Since it's a new approach, data needs to be collected from scratch. I don't thnik the organisation is holding any data related to social media post and comments of employee.

2. **How is the data stored, manipulated right now? What’s your data infrastructure?**
    
    Data is stored on Amazon based cloud service. Data could be mined form social media and or even the real time data can be extracted and stored on cloud.

3. **Do you have internal data-dedicated teams?**
    
    Yes.(Assumption)

## Caveats

1. **What are the constraints on the system being built (resourcing, timing, etc)?**
    
    The main constraints on the system being built is time because the employee are facing the issue right now. Faster the system is built and action is taken, faster the results will be seen on productivity of overall organisation. Another constraint would be, all the employee are no active on social media or we cannot guarantee that they post their true emotions on tweets.

2. **What is the strategy for your organisation? [One year, five years]. Are there considerations that need to be taken into account?**
   
    The strategy would be to immediately form a team that could implement the proposed solution within the span of few months (6 months assumption).

## General 

1. **Do you have a timeline in mind?**

    After the proposal is accepted, the timeline would be:
    - First 2.5 month: Data collection and pre-processing
    - Next 2.5 month: Prototyping and testing
    - Next 1 month: Product deployement
