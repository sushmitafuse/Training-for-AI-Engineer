### Context on the Product

##### 1. Why do you need this new system? What is the business need?
* We need this new system to know whether our packages are appealing to the customers or not. 
* Our main motive is to improve our packages based on the feedback of the customers. 
* Another goal is to recommend the similar destination and tour packages to our customers who are happy with the previous packages.

##### 2. Is there a system in place to do it right now (even if manual)? If so, how is it done right now? Is the process documented? 
* Currently, we manually read the comments on our facebook page and decide whether our customers are satisfied or not. 
* We also review the feedbacks submitted to us by the customers after their visit. 

##### 3. Even if not, How would an expert in the space approach this problem? What would be the variables/pieces of data that person would base a solution on? 
* An expert will first find the emotion related information from the feedback of the customers. 
* An expert will also check happy customers from the reviews and the places they visited to recommend similar places to them.


##### 4. What features do you like about your current system?
* By reading the comments and feedback manually, we were able to gather some information which helped to improve our services. 

##### 5. What features don't you like about the current system?
* As reading the review task is tedious, the creativity of our staffs is not used appropriately. Also, we are not able to gather information from the feedback and reviews at scale.


### About the new system/product

##### 1. What are the basic, crucial needs of the new software?
* To detect the emotion of the people from their feedbacks at scale. This will help to create loyal customers who will again come back for their next travel planning.

##### 2. What benefit can the product provide for your customers?
* More appealing packages can be provided to the customers.

##### 3. What should be the top priority? 
* Detecting the emotion from the feedback/reviews with good accuracy should be the top priority.
* The recommendation feature can be added later on.

##### 4. What are the acceptance criteria, if any? Please be specific.  Do you have systems in place to measure those metrics? 
* The emotion of the text should be correctly classified with at least 80% accuracy in the initial phase. Later on, accuracy should be increased as the data will also increase. To check the metric, we will have a test data manually labeled by our staffs.
* Also, the system should be able to extract emotion related information from the comments in the facebook page as well as from the review in our feedback form.

### System Usage

##### 1. Which of your staff will be using or involved in the product the most? 
* Marketing and planning team will be using the product most of the time.

### About the Data


##### 1. What data do you have that might be related, in any way, to the problem being solved?
* We can provide the data of the feedback/reviews which has been manually labeled by our staffs. 

##### 2. How is the data stored, manipulated right now? What's your data infrastructure?
* Data about the reviews are stored in the excel file. 

##### 3. Do you have internal data-dedicated teams?
* As our company is small, we do not have internal data-dedicated teams.


### Caveats

##### 1. What are the constraints on the system being built (resourcing, timing, etc)? 
* We have less amount of labeled data so, the system should be able to generalize well from these data. 
* As we are quite unaware of how efficient the machine learning algorithms are in detecting emotions from text, we want a working prototype/proof of concept within three years.

##### 2. What is the strategy for your organisation? [One year, five years]. Are there considerations that need to be taken into account?
* In one year, we are targeting to increase our happy customers to 80%. 
* In five years, we aim to become the best brand for travel and tour in the country.


### General

##### 1. Do you have a timeline in mind? 
* For the first six months, we plan to automate our emotion detection from reviews with 80% accuracy.
* During one year, we want our emotion detection system to have accuracy over 90%.
* In two years, we are also planning to implement the recommendation system based on the reviews and previous packages of the customers.
